The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.`  \n- 46 `Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study , focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.`  \n- 47 `From a theoretical viewpoint , probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.`  \n48  \n- 49 `Page: Neural network (machine learning)` 50 `Summary: In machine learning , a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net , abbreviated ANN or NN) is a computational model inspired by the`  \n- `structure and functions of biological neural networks.`  \n- 51 `A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in the brain. Artificial neuron models that mimic biological neurons more closely have also been recently investigated and shown to significantly improve performance. These are connected by edges ,`  \n- `which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons , then processes them and sends a signal to other`  \n- `connected neurons. The \"signal\" is a real number , and the output of each`  \n--- end of page.page_number=9 ---  \n**AI VIETNAM**  \n**aivietnam.edu.vn**  \n- `neuron is computed by some non -linear function of the sum of its inputs , called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight , which adjusts during the learning process.`  \n- 52 `Typically , neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly passing`  \n- `through multiple intermediate layers (hidden layers). A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least two hidden layers.`  \n- 53 `Artificial neural networks are used for various tasks , including predictive modeling , adaptive control , and solving problems in artificial intelligence. They can learn from experience , and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.`  \n54  \n- 55 `Page: Attention (machine learning)` 56 `Summary: Attention is a machine learning method that determines the importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that`  \n- `sequence. In natural language processing , importance is represented by \"soft\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally , attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed -width sequence that can range`  \n- `from tens to millions of tokens in size.`  \n- 57 `Unlike \"hard\" weights , which are computed during the backwards training pass , \" soft\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system , but a more recent design , namely the transformer , removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.`  \n- 58 `Inspired by ideas about attention in humans , the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence , while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenu`  \n59  \n60  \n61  \n- `Update from node agent:`  \n62  \n63  \n- 64  \n- 65",
