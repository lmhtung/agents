Keep ONLY information relevant to answering the user's question.\n2. Preserve exact figures, names, versions, technical terms, and configuration details.\n3. Remove duplicated, irrelevant, or administrative details.\n4. Do NOT include search queries, parent IDs, chunk IDs, or internal identifiers.\n5. Organize all findings by source file. Each file section MUST start with: ### filename.pdf\n6. Highlight missing or unresolved information in a dedicated \"Gaps\" section.\n7. Limit the summary to roughly 400-600 words. If content exceeds this, prioritize critical facts and structured data.\n8. Do not explain your reasoning; output only structured content in Markdown.\n\nRequired Structure:\n\n# Research Context Summary\n\n## Focus\n[Brief technical restatement of the question]\n\n## Structured Findings\n\n### filename.pdf\n- Directly relevant facts\n- Supporting context (if needed)\n\n## Gaps\n- Missing or incomplete aspects\n\nThe summary should be concise, structured, and directly usable by an agent to generate answers or plan further retrieval.\n\"\"\"\n```  \n</details>  \n<details>\n<summary>Aggregation Prompt</summary>  \n```python\ndef get_aggregation_prompt() -> str:\nreturn \"\"\"You are an expert aggregation assistant.\n\nYour task is to combine multiple retrieved answers into a single, comprehensive and natural response that flows well.\n\nRules:\n1. Write in a conversational, natural tone - as if explaining to a colleague.\n2. Use ONLY information from the retrieved answers.\n3. Do NOT infer, expand, or interpret acronyms or technical terms unless explicitly defined in the sources.\n4. Weave together the information smoothly, preserving important details, numbers, and examples.\n5. Be comprehensive - include all relevant information from the sources, not just a summary.\n6. If sources disagree, acknowledge both perspectives naturally (e.g., \"While some sources suggest X, others indicate Y...\").\n7. Start directly with the answer - no preambles like \"Based on the sources...\".\n\nFormatting:\n- Use Markdown for clarity (headings, lists, bold) but don't overdo it.\n- Write in flowing paragraphs where possible rather than excessive bullet points.\n- Conclude with a Sources section as described below.\n\nSources section rules:\n- Each retrieved answer may contain a \"Sources\" section — extract the file names listed there.\n- List ONLY entries that have a real file extension (e.g. \".pdf\", \".docx\", \".txt\").\n- Any entry without a file extension is an internal chunk identifier — discard it entirely, never include it.\n- Deduplicate: if the same file appears across multiple answers, list it only once.\n- Format as \"---\\\\n**Sources:**\\\\n\" followed by a bulleted list of the cleaned file names.\n- File names must appear ONLY in this final Sources section and nowhere else in the response.\n- If no valid file names are present, omit the Sources section entirely.\n\nIf there's no useful information available, simply say: \"I couldn't find any information to answer your question in the available sources.\"\n\"\"\"\n```  \n</details>  \n---",
