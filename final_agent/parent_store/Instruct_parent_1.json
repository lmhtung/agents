Start here if you're new to Agentic RAG or want to experiment quickly.  \n**2️⃣ Building Path: Modular Project**  \nFlexible architecture where each component can be independently swapped — LLM provider, embedding model, PDF converter, agent workflow. One line to switch from Ollama to Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google.  \nSee [Modular Architecture](#modular-architecture) and [Installation & Usage](#installation--usage) to get started.\n\n## How It Works  \n### Document Preparation: Hierarchical Indexing  \nBefore queries can be processed, documents are split twice for optimal retrieval:  \n- **Parent Chunks**: Large sections based on Markdown headers (H1, H2, H3)\n- **Child Chunks**: Small, fixed-size pieces derived from parents  \nThis combines the **precision of small chunks** for search with the **contextual richness of large chunks** for answer generation.  \n---\n\n### Query Processing: Four-Stage Intelligent Workflow\n```\nUser Query → Conversation Summary → Query Rewriting → Query Clarification →\nParallel Agent Reasoning → Aggregation → Final Response\n```  \n**Stage 1 — Conversation Understanding:** Analyzes recent history to extract context and maintain continuity across questions.  \n**Stage 2 — Query Clarification:** Resolves references (\"How do I update it?\" → \"How do I update SQL?\"), splits multi-part questions into focused sub-queries, detects unclear inputs, and rewrites queries for optimal retrieval. Pauses for human input when clarification is needed.  \n**Stage 3 — Intelligent Retrieval (Multi-Agent Map-Reduce):** Spawns parallel agent subgraphs — one per sub-query. Each agent searches child chunks, fetches parent chunks for context, self-corrects if results are insufficient, compresses context to avoid redundant fetches, and falls back gracefully if the search budget is exhausted.  \n> **Example:** *\"What is JavaScript? What is Python?\"* → 2 parallel agents execute simultaneously.  \n**Stage 4 — Response Generation:** Aggregates all agent responses into a single coherent answer.  \n---",
